On May 8th 2017, we had the pleasure of having Mr. Mouri from the Nagoya City Science Museum as a guest speaker in our Network Society Lecture.

Mr. Mouri talked to the students about the history of the Nagoya City Science Museum, its Planetarium, as well as historical data about astronomy and its situation (both past and present) in Japan.

We had the privilege of listening to his interesting talk about some of the technical details of the Nagoya City Science Museum’s Planetarium, this year 2017’s special events schedule and some of the future plans for the further improvement of the Planetarium.

Mr. Mouri, thank you very much for your lecture!
