On May 1st, we had the pleasure of having Mr. Ueno from SEGA as a guest speaker in our Network Society Lecture.

Mr. Ueno talked about his career in SEGA, as well as some of the interesting project he has worked on as part of the company.

After his presentation, students had a chance to ask questions, which led to an interesting series of questions regarding not only the video game industry but also life as a programmer, game designer in SEGA, and technical questions about the latest game development technologies and frameworks.

Mr. Ueno, thank you very much for such a valuable experience!
